  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
  The <head> element is not void, and contains as its children a document's non-visual elements,
  like its title, styles, scripts, favicons, and metadata.
-->
<head>
  <meta lang="en" />
  <title>HTML and JS: A Primer</title>
  <!--
    JavaScript (JS) is a language, like HTML, built with a different purpose in mind: adding
    interactivity to webpages. To link some JS to this document, we'll want to:
      (a) Create a new file on our machine with the .js extension, e.g. index.js.
      (b) Write a <script> element to tell the browser that this document is associated with that file.
    
    A <script> should go in the <head> of an HTML document, since it is inherently non-visual.
    We'll often want to add two attributes to our <script> tags:
      (a) src: The path to our file, e.g. "index.js".
      (b) defer: This tells our browser to run the <script> only after the entire webpage has loaded.
          Note: You may see "DOMContentLoaded" and "load" being used for the same purpose.

    Also note, <script> is a non-void element, so we'll need a closing </script>.
  -->
 <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
</head>

<!-- The <body> contains as its children a document's visual elements, e.g. text, images, etc. -->
<body>
